## Usage

```js
// inside CommonJS
const O = require('observable-air').default
```

```js
// inside es6 or typescript
import O from 'observable-air'
```

## Example
```js
O
  .interval(1000)
  .scan((a, b) => a + b, 0)
  .forEach(x => console.log(x)) // outputs 1, 2 ,3, 4 ...
```

## Installation

```bash
 npm install observable-air --save
```

## Why an RxJS Alternative?
RxJS has a ton of operators that can help you write really concise code. Though most of the operators can be re-created using a set of core operators, combining them to create new ones has significant performance overhead. Because of which most of the operators are re-written using vanilla js (or typescript) and not using composition. This causes a bloat in the size of the library. Overall its neither small nor performant enough to run animations on low end devices.
 
 **Air** tries to mitigate this problem by re-architecting the internals so that there is minimal performance-overhead while composing. This also reduces the size of the library considerably, since less operators need to be shipped in the same bundle be default, thus becoming a lot more suitable for low end devices.
