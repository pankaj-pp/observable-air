## Why use RxJS?

- Tons of operators that can help in writing really concise code.
- It has an active community and is the closest to the [Observable Proposal].
- Contains helpful abstractions such as `Schedulers` and `Subjects`.
- Default support for `jQuery` like fluidic syntax.

## Why use Observable Air?

- Small in size (5kb) when compared to 28kb of RxJS (both minified and gzipped). This reduces [download and parsing] time significantly.
- Wicked fast, checkout the benchmarks section for comparison.
- All operators a `curried` by default so you could `compose` to combine multiple operators to easily create new ones.
- Inter-operates well with [Ramda]. New operators can be created using `R.compose()`. 

## Installation

```bash
 npm install observable-air --save
```
