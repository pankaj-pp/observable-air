## Usage

```js
// inside CommonJS
const O = require('observable-air').default
```

```js
// inside es6 or typescript
import O from 'observable-air'
```

## Example
```js
O
  .interval(1000)
  .scan((a, b) => a + b, 0)
  .forEach(x => console.log(x))
```

## Installation

```bash
 npm install observable-air --save
```

## Why an RxJS Alternative?
RxJS has a ton of operators that can help you write really concise code. Most of the operators can be re-created using a set of core operators. Unfortunately in Rx such a composition has a significant performance impact on the end result. This makes it really unsuitable for doing JS based animations on a low end mobile device.
 
 **Air** tries to mitigate this problem by re-architecting the internals so that there is minimal performance-overhead of composition. This also reduces the size of the library considerably since less operators need to be shipped in the same bundle be default, thus becoming a lot more suitable for low end devices.
